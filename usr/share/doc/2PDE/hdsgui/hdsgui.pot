"Hard Disk Sentinel</b> <i>(hdsentinel)</i> gives information about the "
"temperature and health status of IDE, S-ATA, SCSI and USB hard disk<i>(s)</"
"i> connected to motherboard or external controller cards.\n"
"\t<b>HDS GUI</b> creates a directory of log files at first run, allowing "
"user to look at them then note any suspect changes and a warning blinking "
"systray icon can be displayed if a disk requires attention...\n"
"<b>Notes:</b>\n"
"\tIt is the hard disk itself that detects the problems and <b>Hard Disk "
"Sentinel</b> reads them, interprets and displays them exactly to increase "
"the attention about the change and allow time to prepare<i>(for example)</i> "
"doing a backup.\n"
"\tThe possible bad sectors reported in the text description are no longer "
"used by the hard disk: they are already reallocated. So the spare area is "
"used for all reads and writes targeting those bad sectors. This means that "
"disk surface tests <i>(even the tests in <b>Hard Disk Sentinel</b>)</i> does "
"not access those sectors, but tests the remaining data area and the spare "
"area, so you can be sure that the original <i>(bad)</i> area does not "
"contain important data and cannot risk data loss although having high number "
"of reallocated sectors can be risky - as more problems may be expected with "
"higher chance.\n"
"\tBy using the surface tests, you can verify if the currently used data area "
"is error-free and if there are no further errors reported <i>(no weak, "
"damaged sectors, no further problems)."
